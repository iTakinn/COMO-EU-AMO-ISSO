# To make a class is extremely similar to making a Race, many of the options are the same to be easy to use
# Many of the features are the same

# The difference between the attributes is more of a "addon" onto the attribute the race already has passively
# so for example if a race has a health of 10.0, the class has a health of 2.0, the players overall hearts will be 12.0
# Thats what a class is, it will increase certain or decrease attributes

# the executeCommand works the exact same way as the races
# It also has the ==== ending leaving command execution as the regular config.yml

# ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE
# THESE CLASSES CAN BE USED INSIDE THE MRPREMIUMADDONS CONFIGURATION FOR EXTRA CONFIGURATION
# BUT a class and a race CANNOT be named the same at all, otherwise the plugin will be screwed up




# Now lets get on, on how to "add" more attributes onto a race
# So first we have passiveAttributes list
# We will add an attribute, then a space and then a number that will be added ONTO the base attribute of whatever race the player is
# So for example "GENERIC_MAX_HEALTH 10.0" essentialy it means add 10 extra health onto the players race

# OKAY THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT I mentioned this before but I need to tell you again
# CLASSES CAN BE USED INSIDE MRPREMIUMADDONS (aka abilities), YOU CAN SPICE UP CLASSES A LOT MORE THIS WAY
# a CLASS and a RACE can NEVER be the same name, also note that its the same way to add abilities into a class as it is a race

# Do not touch the "skills" list that is just a temporary placeholder for now until I add types of hardcoded skills into the plugin
# But there are abilities so you can add your own skills which can number in the billions of possibilities



# IGNORE THE "SKILLS" LIST THEY WILL BE USED IN LATER VERSIONS, THEY ARE JUST FOR SETUP

other:

  # Cooldown timer, is in MINUTES, NEVER PUT THIS NUMBER INTO NEGATIVES AND DO NOT TURN THIS NUMBER INTO A DECIMAL AND DO NOT DELETE THE " " MARKS
  cooldown: "1440"
