# Replace any sound played by nature in your server.
#
#  When a sound here is played, PlayMoreSounds interrupts the sound packets from being sent to the
# players and plays the sound set here instead. This way you can take advantage of PlayMoreSounds
# features, like play multiple sounds, delayed sounds, toggleable sounds, permissible sounds,
# resource pack sounds etc.
#
# Warnings:
# >> ProtocolLib is required for this feature to work.
# >> Only sounds played by the server are replaceable, sounds played to the client (like walking or
# building) are replaceable only if the source is another player that's not you.
#
#  To replace a sound, create a section with the sound name and set the replacing sound in it, for
# example:
#
#ENTITY_ZOMBIE_HURT: # This is the sound that I want to replace.
#  Enabled: true
#  Sounds: # The sounds that will play instead.
#    '0':
#      Delay: 0
#      Options:
#        Ignores Disabled: true
#        #Permission Required: '' # Permission Required is available but it's not recommended, use Permission To Listen instead.
#        Permission To Listen: 'listen.zombiehurt'
#        Radius: 0.0 # Radius > 0 is not recommended
#        Relative Location:
#          FRONT_BACK: 0.0
#          RIGHT_LEFT: 0.0
#          UP_DOWN: 0.0
#      Pitch: 0.5
#      Sound: ENTITY_SKELETON_HURT
#      Volume: 1.0
#
#  If you want to completely stop a sound from being played in your server, add as in the example:
#
#ENTITY_ZOMBIE_AMBIENT: # This is the sound that I want to stop from playing in my server.
#  Enabled: true
#  #Sounds: # Don't add 'Sounds' section since you don't want sounds to play.
#
#  A more in depth tutorial of all sound options can be found in sounds.yml file.
#  If you have any other doubts on how to set this configuration up, feel free to ask in
