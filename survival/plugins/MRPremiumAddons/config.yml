# MAKE SURE YOU SET
# broadcast-console-to-ops
# to false inside server.properties

# Here are some ABILITY examples

# CUSTOMABILITY====MATERIAL===={commands}====10===={miliseconds}===={self}===={target}===={event type}
# the first argument which is CUSTOMABILITY, represents that you're telling the plugin hey its a custom ability and now do a bunch of stuff
# the second argument is the MATERIAL of what can be executed/interacted with/ a lot of times this will be ignored if not in certain event types at the end of the arguments
# the third argument is the COMMAND to execute when the conditions are met
# {x} = players X coords | or the entitys coords if the sixth argument is CUSTOM
# {z} = players Z coords | or the entitys coords if the sixth argument is CUSTOM
# {y} = players y coords | or the entitys coords if the sixth argument is CUSTOM
# {hitPlayer} = hit enemy player name
# {name} = players name
# the fourth argument is the CHANCE this occurs, so for example 10 is a 10% chance of it occuring
# the fifth argument is the TIME limit for it to happen again, so 1000 = 1 second, so every 1 second this player can use this ability again
# the sixth argument can either CUSTOM[num] or SELF, this means apply command to SELF OR apply to nearby entities
# the seventh argument means the TARGET of what can be done for the sixth entity, this never applies to the player themselves, this can be either ALL, PLAYERS, MOB, ANIMALS
# the eighth argument is the event type on when to apply these 'effects'
# the eighth argument can either be
#   RIGHTCLICKBLOCKHAND {When a block is right clicked, with the specific material in hand}
#	RIGHTCLICKBLOCK {replace material for what block needs to be right clicked}
#	RIGHTCLICKAIR {replace material for what block needs to be right clicked}
#   LEFTCLICKBLOCKHAND {When a block is left clicked, with the specific material in hand}
#	LEFTCLICKBLOCK {replace material for what block needs to be left clicked}
#	LEFTCLICKAIR {replace material for what block needs to be left clicked}
#	BLOCKBREAK {replace material for what block needs to be destroyed}
#   BLOCKPLACE {replace material for what block needs to be placed}
#   RIGHTCLICKAIRCONSUME {replace material for what needs to be right clicked} - consume item and then execute command
#   LEFTCLICKAIRCONSUME {replace material for what needs to be right clicked} - consume item and then execute command
#	ENTERBED
#	SLEEPING
#	EXITBED
#   EXITVEHICLE
#   ENTERVEHICLE
#	WORLDCHANGEEVENT

#   SUFFOCATIONHURTEVENT
#   PLAYERRESPAWN
#   ISSLEEPING
#   ISBLOCKING
#   WEARINGARMOR {replace material for what armor needs to be worn} and the command will be executed when the player is wearing the armor
#   TIME - Replace {material} with a WORLD TIME, it will execute the command when the WORLD TIME is that time, (do note that it is looking 20 less and more than the time you set [between it, 20 meaning 1 second])
#   PICKUPEVENTCANCEL - when a player picks up an item {material} and cancel the event (cancel the pickup) - note cool down needs to be set to 0 to cancel the event entirely or else the item will be picked up eventually due to the cooldown
#   PICKUPEVENT - when a player picks up an item {material} is the item they need to pick up
#   PASSIVE - this is for passive abilities, this will be executed every time timerCheckingPotionEffects is set to in config.yml
#   ISSPRINTING
#   INBIOME - when a player is in a specific biome {material} is the biome they need to be in
#   DAMAGECAUSEEVENTCANCEL {replace material for what damage cause needs to be cancelled and then command to be executed}
#   HOLDINGITEM {replace material of what item the player needs to hold for it to execute}
#   HOLDITEM {difference between HOLDINGITEM and HOLDITEM is, HOLDITEM only executes the ability once when the item is held, while HOLDINGITEM applies consistently on a timer}
#   HASPOTIONTYPE {Replace material with the type of potion effect, please note that this depends on timerCheckingPotionEffects, if this number is set to 1 then it will instantly detect a potion effect
#                 if its not 1 then it wont instantly detect the potion effect}
#   DAMAGECAUSEEVENT {Replace material with the damage cause, damage cause can be found here -> https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/event/entity/EntityDamageEvent.DamageCause.html}

#   DEATHEVENTCANCEL {if player died then cancel event and execute commands}
#   DEATHEVENT {if player died and execute commands}
#   DEATHEVENTCAUSE {if player died and execute commands, replace material with the cause of death} <- https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/event/entity/EntityDamageEvent.DamageCause.html
#   DEATHEVENTCAUSECANCEL {if player died from a specific cause then cancel event and execute commands}
#   CHATWHISPEREVENT {replace material as the players message needed to trigger} this means if correct word is said, CANCEL the event BUT execute the command (so it doesnt clutter chat up)
#   CHATLOUDEVENT {replace material as the players message needed to trigger} this means execute command if the correct word was said BUT the message will still be said in chat
#   PLAYERCONSUMEEVENT {replaces the materials argument with your own item of consumed item name}
#   PLAYERJOINEVENT
# You may use as many abilities as you want per race or class, each one can be unique

# LEFTCLICKAIR, RIGHTCLICKAIRCONSUME, RIGHTCLICKAIR, HOLDINGITEM, PICKUPEVENT, PICKUPEVENTCANCEL, HASITEMININVENTORY, RESTRICTITEMFROMINVENTORY and the ray trace special types
# can use custom model ID inside the {material}
# Some RESTRICT types also use custom model ID, just scroll down to the RESTRICT types to see what they are

# for example
#  - 'CUSTOMABILITY====123:,IRON_INGOT,412:====say hey i executed====100====10====SELF====ALL====RIGHTCLICKAIR'
# By putting a number with a colon to the right of it will indicate to the plugin that it is looking for a custom model ID instead of a material
# So it will check if the item right-clicked has a custom model id of 123, or 412 or an iron ingot
# This is useful for servers that have more specific RPG components that want to have special types of items to be executed

# For example to test that out you can use this command to give you an item
# /give @s minecraft:feather{CustomModelData:123}
# This will give you a feather with a custom model id of 123

# Let us look a bit more into special placeholders that replace {x} {y] {z}
# We can replace them with {[mathX+100]}, what this will do is, add 100 to the players X coords
# We can replace them with {[mathY-10]}, what this will do is, subtract 10 to the players Y coords
# We can replace them with {[mathZ*3]}, what this will do is, multiple 3 to the players Z coords
# We can also do something like this {[mathZ/2]}, what this will do is, divide the players Z coords by 2
# Do note that you can only do one math operation per placeholder, so you can't do {[mathZ/2+100]}, you can only do one math operation per placeholder

# You can also use the rand() inside the command, for example you can do rand(banana, apple, carrot) and it will randomly pick one of the three
# You can have an ability that looks like this with the rand() function as an example
# - 'CUSTOMABILITY====IRON_INGOT===say rand(hey, hello, hi) i executed====100====10====SELF====ALL====RIGHTCLICKAIR'


# Let us dive into another feature ability for CHATWHISPEREVENT and CHATLOUDEVENT
# These two abilities have the means to take placeholders from the player and insert them into the command
# For example
# CUSTOMABILITY====Server repeat me! {0};====say {0} was said ====100====10====SELF====ALL====CHATLOUDEVENT
# If the player types 'Server repeat me! test' in chat
# then the following command will be used
# 'say test was said'
# You can use up to 5 placeholders ranging from {0} to {5}
# Don't forget to put a semicolon at the end to indicate to the plugin you are using player placeholders

# Now lets get onto something a tad more complicated for custom abilities and making
# the "ability" look nice when executing it

# That means particle effects!

# Inside the {self} you know it can either be SELF or CUSTOM

# Self being the player and CUSTOM[num] being surrounding entities

# With this template
# SELF/CUSTOM[num]:PARTICLEEFFECT:LENGTH:SPACING:INSTANT/MEDIUM/FAST/SLOW:TYPE

# PARTICLEEFFECT is the particle effect to be used
# Particle effects can be split using a comma
# From this site https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Particle.html
# Length being the "size" of the shape and "spacing" being the spacing number between each particle of the shape
# INSTANT/MEDIUM/FAST/SLOW define on when to display the particles at a set speed
# the TYPE can be one of these
# CONE, REVERSECONE, CUBE, SPIRAL, RANDOMDOTS, 4CIRCLES, CIRCLE, INNERCIRCLES, OUTCIRCLES, TRIPLELINE, CROSS, UPWARDCIRCLES, ALIENSPHERE

# This youtube video can help you set up these new particle effects -> https://youtu.be/zVY-RAYlLUY

# Some special cases of 'CUSTOM' ability can be this
# CUSTOMABILITY====MATERIAL===={command}===={chance}===={miliseconds}===={self}===={target}===={event type}====REPEATING===={repeating timer}===={ending command}
# Repeating means - Repeat {command} every '{repeating timer}' ticks, and if the player triggers the event again, the timer will end and the {ending command} will be executed

# CUSTOMABILITY====MATERIAL===={command}===={chance}===={miliseconds}===={self}===={target}===={event type}====ONCE===={ending command}
# This means if the event was triggered, then do "{command}", if the event is triggered again then {ending command} is triggered

# CUSTOMABILITY====MATERIAL===={command}====10====1000====SELF====ALL===={event type}===={latercommand}===={timing}
# Means if event is triggered then do command, after {timing} which is in ticks, execute {latercommand}

# CUSTOMABILITY====MATERIAL===={command}====10====1000====SELF====ALL====RIGHTCLICKAIRRAYTRACE===={distance}
# Means if the player is looking at an entity while right-clicking MATERIAL, within distance {distance} then do command for entity, note {x} {y} and {z} would be the entity coords

# CUSTOMABILITY====MATERIAL===={command}====10====1000====SELF====ALL====RIGHTCLICKAIRRAYTRACEBLOCK===={distance}
# Means if the player is looking at an entity while right-clicking MATERIAL, within distance {distance} then do command for entity, note {x} {y} and {z} would be the entity coords

# CUSTOMABILITY====MATERIAL===={command}====10====1000====SELF====ALL====RIGHTCLICKAIRRAYTRACELOCATION===={distance}
# Meaning execute commands, along the coords between the player and the entity that it passes through {x} {y} {z}

# CUSTOMABILITY====MATERIAL===={command}====10====1000====SELF====ALL====RIGHTCLICKAIRRAYTRACELOCATIONBLOCK===={distance}
# Meaning execute commands, along the coords between the player and the entity that it passes through {x} {y} {z}
# And it will stop once it hits a SOLID block

# CUSTOMABILITY====MATERIAL===={command}====10====1000====SELF====ALL====LEFTCLICKAIRRAYTRACE===={distance}
# Means if the player is looking at an entity while right-clicking MATERIAL, within distance {distance} then do command for entity, note {x} {y} and {z} would be the entity coords

# CUSTOMABILITY====MATERIAL===={command}====10====1000====SELF====ALL====LEFTCLICKAIRRAYTRACEBLOCK===={distance}
# Means if the player is looking at an entity while right-clicking MATERIAL, within distance {distance} then do command for entity, note {x} {y} and {z} would be the entity coords

# CUSTOMABILITY====MATERIAL===={command}====10====1000====SELF====ALL====LEFTCLICKAIRRAYTRACELOCATION===={distance}
# Meaning execute commands, along the coords between the player and the entity that it passes through {x} {y} {z}

# CUSTOMABILITY====MATERIAL===={command}====10====1000====SELF====ALL====LEFTCLICKAIRRAYTRACELOCATIONBLOCK===={distance}
# Meaning execute commands, along the coords between the player and the entity that it passes through {x} {y} {z}
# And it will stop once it hits a SOLID block

# All ray trace types have another placeholder which is {uuid} which is the uuid of the entity that was hit or passed through

# Another ability is
# INFLICTDAMAGEEVENT====say hello====10====10000
# When a player damages another entity or player
# {x} = enemys X coords
# {y} = enemys Y coords
# {z} = enemys Z coords
# {hitPlayer} = hit enemy player name
# {name} = players name
# {hitUUID} - hit enemy UUID
# first argument is stating what the plugin should do with the line
# second argument is the command
# third argument is chance, so 10 is 10% chance
# fourth argument is cool down time, 1000 = 1 second

# When a player receives damage from an entity
# RECIEVEDAMAGEFROMENTITY====say hello====10====10000
# {x} = enemys X coords
# {y} = enemys Y coords
# {z} = enemys Z coords
# {hitPlayer} = hit enemy player name
# {name} = players name
# first argument is stating what the plugin should do with the line
# second argument is the command
# third argument is chance, so 10 is 10% chance
# fourth argument is cooldown time, 1000 = 1 second

# You can also do this
# LEVELUP===={command}
# OR it could look like this LEVELUP===={command}===={level needed to execute command}
# Meaning if the player has leveled up in a their race execute X command

# FRIENDLYMOBS====MOBNAME,MOBNAME,MOBNAME
# second arguments separated by commas are telling the plugin which mobs are friendly to the player itself and the mobs wont attack them at all

# PROJECTILEEVENT====ARROW====say hello====10====10000
# When a player damages another entity or player
# {x} = enemy's X coords
# {y} = enemys Y coords
# {z} = enemys Z coords
# {hitPlayer} = hit enemy player name
# {name} = players name
# first argument is stating what the plugin should do with the line
# second argument is what the projectile should be to hit the enemy entity or player
# third argument is chance, so 10 is 10% chance
# fourth argument is cooldown time, 1000 = 1 second


# Now heres a very important detail, so
# YOU COULD do this at the end of each CUSTOM ABILITY/projectile data
# [ability]===={message}===={type}====NOTIFY
# {cooldown} is the cooldown
# {type} can either be HOTBAR/ACTIONBAR/MESSAGE
# this is what is sent to the player

# We also have another feature for the FIRST word of the events
# Example, PROJECTILEEVENT,FRIENDLYMOBS etc
# If you do "CUSTOMABILITY;10==== rest of the ability"
# This will mean, the player has to be level 10 or above for this specific ability to execute with its events

# RESTRICTARMOR===={material}
# Player will not be able to wear armor

# RESTRICTWEAPON===={material}
# Player will not be able to use weapon

# RESTRICTTOOL==={material}
# Player will not be able to use a certain tool

# RESTRICTFOOD==={material}
# Player will not be able to use a certain tool
# Note that this does use the ITEMCONSUME event, so if you want to restrict food or another consumable item, you can use this
# It doesn't just have to be food

# RESTRICTITEMSFROMINVENTORY==={material}
# Player will not be able to be able to have the item in their inventory
# can use custom model ID inside the {material} placeholder
# Example
# RESTRICTITEMSFROMINVENTORY====1:,IRON_INGOT,2:
# This will mean the player will not be able to have any item with a custom model ID of 1, 2 or an iron ingot in their inventory

# ^ RESTRICTWEAPON, RESTRICTITEMSFROMINVENTORY, RESTRICTFOOD, RESTRICTARMOR
# These four in total will restrict the player from using the item, wearing the armor, eating the food or using the tool
# This is useful for making a class that can only use a certain weapon, or a class that can only use a certain tool
# These four are also abilities that support custom model ID
# Examples
# RESTRICTWEAPON====1:,IRON_SWORD,2:
# This will mean the player will not be able to use any item with a custom model ID of 1, 2 or an iron sword
# RESTRICTARMOR====1:,IRON_CHESTPLATE,2:
# This will mean the player will not be able to wear any item with a custom model ID of 1, 2 or an iron chestplate
# RESTRICTFOOD====1:,APPLE,2:
# This will mean the player will not be able to eat any item with a custom model ID of 1, 2 or an apple

# IMMUNETOX===={potion effect type}
# it can be seperacted using a comma


# EXTRADMG====RACE/CLASS====[num]
# Do extra damage to a race or class with extra dmg at the end
# Example  EXTRADMG====Cat====3.0 does 3 extra damage to the Cat race


# There is also another way to make abilities
# We can use the abilities folder
# The process is similar to the ability creation here, however, its more easy to read/understand and re-use abilities
# Lets take a small ability for an example, RESTRICTWEAPON===={material}
#
# We can create a file inside the abilities folder called RestrictWeapon.yml [This can be any name you want]
# Inside of this file we can do the following
# ------- (The dashes are not apart of the file)
# RESTRICTWEAPON
# WOODEN_SWORD
# ----
# Youtube video -> https://youtu.be/MoymyJ219_4
# Then the ability will be constructed as RESTRICTWEAPON====WOODEN_SWORD when the plugin starts
# You can also use comments within the file, for example
# -----
# # Ability Type
# RESTRICTWEAPON
# Material
# WOODEN_SWORD
# -----
# This will make the abilities easier to read and make
# Then we can go to a specific race inside of this folder
# Inside the 'abilities' list of a specific race, we can call that ability file we made as follows,
#
# abilities:
#   'LOAD=RestrictWeapon.yml'
#   'LOAD={File name of the ability}
#
# If you are still confused, you can watch the youtube tutorial video -> https://youtu.be/MoymyJ219_4


# Some helpful commands
# execute at {name} run effect give @e[sort=nearest,x={x},y={y},z={z},limit=1] minecraft:poison 3 10
# An example of some 'Abilities'
# CUSTOMABILITY====GRASS_BLOCK====heal {name}====100====10====CUSTOM5====ALL====RIGHTCLICKAIR
# This means on RIGHT click in the air, with the item grass block in the hand
# CUSTOMABILITY====SALMON====say {name}====100====10====SELF====ALL====RIGHTCLICKAIR====REPEATING====30====say ending
# INFLICTDAMAGEEVENT====execute at {name} run effect give @e[sort=nearest,x={x},y={y},z={z},limit=1] minecraft:poison 3 10====100====10000
# PROJECTILEEVENT====ARROW====execute at {name} run effect give @e[sort=nearest,x={x},y={y},z={z},limit=1] minecraft:poison 3 10====100====10000
# If the player shoots a projectile and its called "ARROW" then give the entity that was hit poison with a 10 second cooldown TRY timer
# FRIENDLYMOBS====WITCH,ZOMBIE | Meaning the entities, "witch and zombie" are friendly towards the player
# CUSTOMABILITY====STRING====effect give {name} minecraft:invisibility 60 0====100====5000====SELF====ALL====RIGHTCLICKAIR====REPEATING====100====effect clear {name} | meaning give player invis every 5 seconds when they right click string
# if they right click it again then disable the giving of invis and clear all effects of the player
# please note that the miliseconds mean every X miliseconds then TRY again, not if the command was successful



# ALSO NOTE THAT YOU CAN ALSO PUT CLASSES HERE FOR ABILITIES!
# So races and classes can use abilities


other:

  # When night time starts in ticks
  nightStart: 12610

  # When day time starts in ticks
  nightEnd: 23041

  # This timer does not check for potion effects (it could if the ability says to check for potion effects), its the tick timer for abilities, such as the checking for certain situations the player is in
  # This is more of an when to check for changes to a player timer, example when hit by a potion effect or holding a certain item etc
