Description\r\nI have recently run into an issue where a world, when created quickly enough after deletion of a world with the same name, will not store data. I have tested this extensively and narrowed the issue down to [this](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/thebusybiscuit/slimefun4/implementation/tasks/TickerTask.java#L102) ticker code and [this](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/me/mrCookieSlime/Slimefun/api/BlockStorage.java#L116) check for the world's existence. Since the ticker code only runs every half second, it does not remove the world from the registry until up to a Slimefun tick later and therefore causes issues in the constructor.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to recreate this issue is to delete a world and immediately create a new one with the same name.\r\n\r\nFull credits go to @gecko10000 for some reason (my git skills most likely) his PR got closed while i tried to update it.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nThis PR changes the registry to use UUIDs instead of the world names themselves. This _does not_ affect the storage location in files and therefore these are not breaking changes.\r\n\r\nThis may not be the ideal way to do it; it may be better to remove the world from the registry [here](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/thebusybiscuit/slimefun4/implementation/listeners/WorldListener.java#L28) instead.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\nNo issue opened\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\ncreatePreset is a very useful function when writing addons, it allows us to not worry about re-writing the canOpen method that handles block permissions. The only downside for common use is that you can't bind menu click events easily since there's no support for newInstance without actually creating your own BlockMenuPreset instance directly. The problem with that is you must then overwrite canOpen yourself too - which is dangerous as an Addon developer. There are reasons you might want  to do that still (such as private machines only the placer can open), but for generic use it feels quite dangerous since responding to inventory clicks is quite a common use when you add custom functionality like collecting a non-item resource manually from machines (such as XP, or maybe money)\r\n\r\nThere is probably a much better way of doing this, it's more a \"proof of concept\" so I didn't worry too much about formatting being messed up or fully testing this.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- Please explain what changes you have made to the code. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nAn additional override for createPreset that allows passing a function to newInstance directly, thus negating the downsides for most common uses of createPreset.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n<!-- Please tag any Issues related to your Pull Request -->\r\n<!-- Syntax: \"Resolves #000\" -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

If you have Slimefun item that is placable (+more, tried it with machines, cargo, solar panels, backpacks) in your main hand, it plants a seed which after destroying drops the item that was in your hand. I asked Vehicles support and they found out that the error causing it is probably line 80. I am sending some messages from him:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19331474/218342787-f9cf8547-8f93-4959-80eb-c95802684c0c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19331474/218342790-c80efdfa-cc01-4c27-b1b0-7468d9eac6c2.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19331474/218342799-2b04763a-0e3a-4cbe-b8e5-3f058abae69f.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19331474/218342803-e8a56951-59bb-4bc9-9e46-d71a83d96bee.png)\r\n\r\n(Server is running on Waterfall - Yatopia)\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Ride a tractor\r\n2. Put in seeds\r\n3. Put the Slimefun item in your main hand\r\n4. Ride over farmland\r\n5. Destroy the seed (doesn’t have to be grown)\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nIt shouldn’t interfere with what you are planting, it should plant the item that is in the vehicle trunk.\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\nhttps://medal.tv/games/minecraft/clips/UYm6TSvGIMsVI/d1337wv7pVSz?invite=cr-MSxwTEIsMjc4MTU2MzIs\n\n### 📜 Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### 💻 Server Software\n\nOther (please specify in your description)\n\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\n\n1.18.x\n\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19331474/218342712-797531a4-a52c-4cb5-b1b4-084b185da4c8.png)\r\n\n\n### 🧭 Other plugins\n\nVehicles - https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9C%88%EF%B8%8Fvehicles-no-resourcepacks-needed.12446/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3767/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3764","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3764/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3764/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3764/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3764","id":1576838319,"node_id":"I_kwDOATMVe85d_KSv","number":3764,"title":"Gold pan & Nether Gold Pan","user":{"login":"roracle","id":9681146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2ODExNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9681146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roracle","html_url":"https://github.com/roracle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roracle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roracle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roracle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roracle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roracle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roracle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roracle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roracle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roracle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-02-08T21:42:31Z","updated_at":"2023-02-11T13:06:29Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### ❗ Checklist\n\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\n- [X] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\n\n### 📍 Description\n\nWith Orebfuscator installed and running, using a gold pan or nether gold pan will leave behind obfuscated ores and not clean up like it's meant to.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1.

The bug is that SF electricity generators are changing to vanilla items, but all items can change this way based on the code from the error I'm posting below. \r\n\r\nPlease fix this as soon as possible, this is a very serious bug as players may start to abuse it and ask us to replace a vanilla block with an op generator, but the block was never a generator.\r\n\r\n\n\n### 📑 Reproduction

Description\r\nThis isn't directly for Slimefun. Many addons have blocks that display information about their current operational status within a GUI inventory. While this is a good way to do this from the player's perspective, this creates a BlockMenu that is kept in RAM indefinitely which has recently been the cause of some issues. While the block storage rewrite will likely be the best 'fix' for this, for now this is to allow addons to remove information-only GUIs for their machines.\r\n\r\nThe biggest 'offender' for this is InfinityExpansion which in my most recent example server had 70k~ of these inventories which are, effectively, wasting RAM - and a lot of it.\r\nIf accepted I will be using this in Infinity, Networks and Tinker and will recommend to any other addons with similar blocks.\r\n\r\nThis solution will allow addons to display the information they are trying to put forward through the MultiMeter\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nAdd a new ItemAttribute that addons can implement to add additional messages to the MultiMeter.\r\n\r\nThis could easily be a new tool instead. While I think it fits well in the MultiMeter, I'm happy to make a new item for this purpose.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

This only happens to Slimefun blocks, vanilla blocks will drop just fine. Also this seems to clear block storage data on that coordinate as well.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Enable `call-explosive-event` on explosive pickaxe\r\n2. Try to break Slimefun blocks\r\n3. See it only drops the one you are hitting with it\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nIt should drop all the Slimefun blocks\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OG7TwUCqqzg\n\n### 📜 Server

❗ Checklist\n\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\n- [X] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\n\n### 📍 Description\n\nHi, I was recently creating an SMP server, and I tried installing ItemsAdder, Slimefun, and an ItemsAdder addon called IAxPresenceFootsteps, which adds compatibility for the mod Presence Footsteps to ItemsAdder.\r\nhttps://github.com/Andre601/IAxPresenceFootsteps\r\nHowever, when I tested the mod, I noticed that when Slimefun was installed, it caused IAxPresenceFootsteps to load before ItemsAdder instead of after, and since ItemsAdder is a dependency of IAxPresenceFootsteps, the plugin doesn't work.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Download the latest versions of Slimefun, ItemsAdder, and IAxPresenceFootsteps to a server.\r\n2. Start the server\r\n3. Notice that IAxPresenceFootsteps loads before ItemsAdder instead of after like it should?\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nI expected IAxPresenceFootsteps to load after ItemsAdder like it normally does instead of before as it did here.\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📜 Server Log\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/mc7i7tZP\n\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### 💻 Server Software\n\nPaper\n\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\n\n1.18.x\n\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\n\nSlimefun version DEV - 1014 (git f431aa6d)\n\n### 🧭 Other plugins\n\nItemsAdder, IAxPresenceFootsteps","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3575/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3572","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3572/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3572/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3572/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3572","id":1251721814,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe844oeSe","number":3572,"title":"Update dependency com.github.seeseemelk:MockBukkit-v1.18 to v2.85.2","user":{"login":"renovate[bot]","id":29139614,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjkxMzk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/2740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/renovate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1401731428,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDAxNzMxNDI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A8%20Dependency%20Update","name":"🚨 Dependency Update","color":"4d72d2","default":false,"description":"One of our dependencies needs an update."},{"id":4270511434,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATMVe87-itVK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%E2%9A%A0BLOCKED","name":"⚠BLOCKED","color":"FF0000","default":false,"description":"This pull request is currently blocked from merging for technical reasons."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2022-05-28T20:50:06Z","updated_at":"2023-07-17T03:03:30Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/3572","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3572","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3572.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3572.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"[![Mend Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [com.github.seeseemelk:MockBukkit-v1.18](https://togithub.com/MockBukkit/MockBukkit) | `2.0.0` -> `2.85.2` | [![age](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/age/maven/com.github.seeseemelk:MockBukkit-v1.18/2.85.2?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/adoption/maven/com.github.seeseemelk:MockBukkit-v1.18/2.85.2?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/compatibility/maven/com.github.seeseemelk:MockBukkit-v1.18/2.0.0/2.85.2?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/confidence/maven/com.github.seeseemelk:MockBukkit-v1.18/2.0.0/2.85.2?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### ⚠ Dependency Lookup Warnings ⚠\n\nWarnings were logged while processing this repo.

The main problem I need to fix, is actually fact that players are able to enchant mmoitems witch blocked use in enchanting tables or anvils in sf autoenchanters. in. My items are blocked against enchanting but in sf you can simply bypass it. I know there's a way to add blocked lore. But what about old items without that lore? A lot of of my players using items without this lore.\r\n\r\nSo what I need to add ?\r\nEasily check stats from mmoitem and if it has blocked using in crafting, enchanting.., it won't be possible to upgrade this item. This will be probably better than using lores, because it will apply to all items no matter how old those items are.\r\n\r\nLet me know, if it is possible, thanks and have a good day!\r\n\r\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nCreate an mmoitem and block it's interaction in enchanting tables/anvils.\r\nAdd this item to slimefun autoenchanter.\r\nYou can add this item there.\r\n\r\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nMMOItems with blocked features like using them in enchanting tables, they should not be usable in sf as well.\r\n\r\n### 📷 Screenshots /

📔 Introduction\r\nOver the last few months and years you all have often requested for us to be more open in regards to upcoming changes.\r\nSo we decided its time to finally release a proper roadmap.\r\nNote here that this roadmap will never be complete and final, we may add or change some goals from time to time and we will refrain from setting a release date for things until absolutely certain.\r\n\r\nThis simply serves as a rough guide for you to see what changes you can be excited about.\r\nMany of those changes will likely be of technical nature though, so they may not be as exciting or intesting at first.\r\n\r\nAlso, we aren't actively looking for pull requests towards these goals unless explicitly requested.\r\nIf you wish to make a pull request, choose any open issue or approved suggestion and you are more than welcome :heart:\r\nThese changes however are mainly targeted towards the core team.\r\n\r\n## ⭐ Upcoming changes\r\nSome of these milestones will have a date assigned to them.\r\nBut the majority of milestones are still to far away to even have a date ready here.\r\nThose are marked as *TBD* (to be decided).\r\n\r\n| Symbol | Type of change |\r\n| :---: | :------- |\r\n| 🔧 | Technical change / API |\r\n| 🎈 | New Features |\r\n| 💡 | Performance improvements |\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Older changes</summary>\r\n\r\n### 🔧 ~~(September 3rd - 6th 2021) API relocation~~ - **DONE**\r\nThe first upcoming change is a major relocation of some of our classes to unify some packages, get rid of old classpaths and to follow the general conventions. You can read more about this here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3139\r\n\r\n### 🔧 ~~(Q3 2022) Updating to Java 16~~\r\nSlimefun will update to Java 16.\r\nYou can see the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3602\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### 🎈(Q3 2022) New sound-system\r\nSoon we will allow server owners to fully configure any sound in this plugin.\r\nThis will also work with custom sounds from resource packs. Additionally you can change the pitch and volume of any sound or even mute it.\r\nYou can see the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2844\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (2023) Inventory system rewrite\r\nNext up is a rewrite for our inventory-system. The API is very rusty and aged. We don't have an ETA yet, perhaps closely after or along with the aforementioned API relocation.\r\nThe new system will be much more flexible and easier to use for developers.\r\n\r\n### 🎈 (2023) Changes to the radiation system\r\nThanks to @Semisol you will soon be able to enjoy a new radiation system which works by calculating a so-called \"exposure level\" to a radioactive substance. You won't experience radiation symptoms until a certain exposure level has been reached.\r\nThis will also make the different radiation levels much more distinct from each other and the features comes with a few good-looking UI changes too! You can track the progress of that here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3189\r\n\r\n### 🎈 (2023) SQL database support and Research system rewrite\r\nThe Research system will be rewritten api-wise.\r\nWe will also drop numeric ids for researches and solely rely on namespaced keys.\r\nIn addition to this, we will add support for SQL databases to sync researches across multiple servers.\r\nAlternatively, a local file-based database can be used.\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (2023) Recipe system rewrite\r\nOur recipe system is in deep need of a rewrite, it needs to be much less item-comparison based and we should allow alternate ingredients through the use of material tags or slimefun item classes and such.\r\nI will be doing this rewrite myself and some infrastructure has been set up already but nothing to show you yet, it is still a while until we get there.\r\n\r\n### 🎈 (2023) Programmable androids rewrite\r\nProgrammable androids are great.\r\nBut they can be better! We will be stripping the data of an android from its block and give it a unique identity instead.\r\nThe UI will be completely redone and it will have much better performance.

Create a simple cargo setup consisting of one cargo manager, one cargo input node and one cargo output node\r\n2.

Destroy the Electric Furnace exactly after the TickerTask has processed Block removals and before it starts processing the tick of the cargo manager\r\n4. Observe how items are transferred into the destroyed Electric Furnace and are destroyed immediately afterwards as the TickerTask processes the removal of the Electric Furnace \r\n\r\nFrom my testing this is a very rare occasion, and as such a very hard bug to reproduce.\r\nHowever, with the help of a debugger which is capable of pausing the async TickerTask, it is reproducible every time\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nThe item does not transfer, or drops in the world\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n - Minecraft Version: v1_15_R1\r\n - Slimefun Version: DEV 489 (git d8964)\r\n - CS-CoreLib Version: v1.6.3\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","id":204901222,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDQ5MDEyMjI=","number":121,"title":"Cargo Input Nodes don't transfer whitelisted Items if not-whitelisted items come first","user":{"login":"BlackBeltPanda","id":5866087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjYwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5866087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda","html_url":"https://github.com/BlackBeltPanda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2642156940,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjQyMTU2OTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%A7%A8%20Confirmed%20Bug","name":"🧨 Confirmed Bug","color":"B3EFFA","default":false,"description":"This bug has been confirmed by our team."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2017-02-02T15:12:02Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T02:49:40Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Description\r\nWith an Input Node in Blacklist mode and no items blacklisted, connected to a chest with an Advanced Output Node with an item whitelisted, if any items are blocking the slots before the whitelisted item in the input chest with nowhere to go, the whitelisted item never gets transported.\r\n\r\n## Evidence / Proof\r\nGIF: https://i.gyazo.com/7199e6c7f7e7f173fa3c7f1dfa778efc.gif\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nMC version: 1.11.2 (git-Paper-1032)\r\nCS-CoreLib version: 1.5.12\r\nSlimefun version: 4.1.1\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}]
