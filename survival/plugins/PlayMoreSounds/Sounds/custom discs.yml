# Set a sound to play when a player clicks at a jukebox with a specific item.
#
# Warnings: 
#   >> You must be on version 1.14+!
#   >> Players must have the permission 'playmoresounds.disc.use'.
#   >> Delayed sounds will not stop when the disc is removed.
#   >> For performance reasons, the sound will only play if you have only 1 disc in your hand.
#   >> When the disc is removed the sound will only stop for the player who removed it,
#   meaning if the sound has a radius the sound will not be stopped to the players in
#   the radius.
#
# To set a sound, just create a configuration section with an id and set the item name,
# material and lore or just copy the sample.
