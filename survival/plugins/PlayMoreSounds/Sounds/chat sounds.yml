# Set a sound to play when a player type a sentence in chat.
#
#  There are five filters to choose:
#
#  -> Contains:
#  Use this section to play a sound to every message that contains the word you specify.
#  Sample:
#
#Contains:
#  hello:
#    Cancellable: true
#    Enabled: true
#    Prevent Other Sounds:
#      Default Sound: true # This will prevent the default sound set on sounds.yml from playing.
#      Other Filters: true # If the message match other filters, this will make so this is the only filter that will play a sound.
#
#  -> Contains SubString:
#  Use this section to play a sound to every message that contains the following string you specify.
#  This is different than Contains because Contains check for words, this checks for any part of the message.
#  Sample:
#
#Contains SubString:
#  pling:
#    Cancellable: true
#    Enabled: true
#    Prevent Other Sounds:
#      Default Sound: true # This will prevent the default sound set on sounds.yml from playing.
#      Other Filters: true # If the command match other filters, this will make so this is the only filter that will play a sound.
#
#  -> Ends With:
#  Self explanatory. If a message ends with the sentence specified, the sound will play.
#  Sample:
#
#Ends With:
#  something:
#    Cancellable: true
#    Enabled: true
#    Prevent Other Sounds:
#      Default Sound: true
#      Other Filters: true
#    Sounds:
#      '0':
#        Delay: 0
#        Options:
#          Radius: 0.0
#        Pitch: 1.0
#        Sound: 'ENTITY_CREEPER_PRIMED'
#        Volume: 10.0
#
#  -> Equals Exactly:
#  When a message equals exactly like the specified here. (Case sensitive)
#  Sample:
#
#Equals Exactly:
#  play BLOCK_PORTAL_TRAVEL sound:
#    Cancellable: true
#    Enabled: true
#    Prevent Other Sounds:
#      Default Sound: true
#      Other Filters: true
#    Sounds:
#      '0':
#        Delay: 1
#        Options:
#          Radius: 0.0
#        Pitch: 2.0
#        Sound: 'BLOCK_PORTAL_TRAVEL'
#        Volume: 0.4
#
#  -> Equals Ignore Case:
#  When a message is equals to the specified but, it doesn't matter if it's on lower case or
# upper case.
#  If a player accidentally toggled upper case on it's keyboard and typed SOMETHING and you want
# to set a sound for the message "something", put it in this section so the sound will be played
# even if its on upper case.
#  Sample:
#
#Equals Ignore Case:
#  something:
#    Cancellable: false
#    Enabled: true
#    Prevent Other Sounds:
#      Default Sound: true
#      Other Filters: true
#    Sounds:
#      '1':
#        Delay: 0
#        Options:
#          Radius: 0.0
#        Pitch: 2.0
#        Sound: 'BLOCK_PORTAL_TRAVEL'
#        Volume: 0.4
#
#  -> Starts With:
#  Plays a sound when a message starts with the sentence you specify.
#  Sample:
#
#Starts With:
#  hello:
#    Cancellable: true
#    Enabled: true
#    Prevent Other Sounds:
#      Default Sound: true
#      Other Filters: true
#    Sounds:
#      '1':
#        Delay: 0
#        Options:
#          Radius: 0.0
#        Pitch: 2.0
#        Sound: 'BLOCK_PORTAL_TRAVEL'
#        Volume: 0.4
